Robot Fight Club Arena v0.10 (master)

Robot Fight Club Arena is a platform of Python and Arduino (C) that uses Python 2.7+, Arduino v1.0.3+, OpenCV 2.4.5+, and zbar 0.10 to scan a video source for QR codes for robot positions, if the robot is alive, and the arena's edges.  The position is sent out via an Arduino transmitter using a Virtual Wire 433Mhz Radio to each Arduino robot.  Each robot has a balloon covering it's DEAD symbol that also holds down it's power button.  When it's balloon pops the robot turns off.

The game is simple.  Each robot tries to pop the balloon of the other robots and be the last alive.

We are currently in Beta stages.  Positioning works but could use optimizations.  The 433Mhz Radio that each Arduino uses to received the position of itself and the other robots could use review.  The QR scanning with zbar can be set to focus on just the arena area.  Setting zbar to increase the number of scanning passes on certain areas of the image is also possible.
