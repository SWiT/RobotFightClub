Transmitter:

The transmitter is attached to the host PC via USB. Commmands are sent by opening the appropriate
serial port and writing newline-terminated strings.
The arduino code on the transmitter repeatedly sends a packet held in memory.
The structure of the packet is defined in rkf_packet.h



Transmitter command summary:

    start <xmit_period> <baudrate>
    pos <robot_num> <x> <y> <heading> <valid>
    reset
    data <byte0> <byte1> ... <byte26>



Transmitter commands:


start <xmit_period> <baudrate>

    On reset, the transmitter sends nothing until the start command is sent.
    Once the start command is sent, the transmitter continually sends the packet in memory.
    You may optionally specify the transmit repeat period in milliseconds (default 500)
    and the RF baud rate (default 2400).
    
    example: start 100 2400



pos <robot_num> <x> <y> <heading> <valid>

    The packet consists of a some header bytes and an array of 8 robot position structures.
    Use the "pos" command to modify one of the robot positions.
    
        parameters: 
    
            robot_num  index of the position structure to modify.  0 to 7
            x          the x coordinate. 0 to 255
            y          the y coordinate. 0 to 255
            heading    the direction the bot is facing. 0 to 15
            valid      flag indicating whether position report n contains valid data. 0 or 1






reset

    The reset command makes the transmitter stop transmitting and clears the packet buffer.
